# AN0009: Fix TimeSpan formatting

| Property                    | Value    |

| Id                          | AN0009   |
| Category                    | Formatting    |
| Default Severity            | Warning  |

When formatting a `TimeSpan` using one the following is always invalid:

Year and month does not apply `TimeSpan`
* `y`
* `Y`
* `yy`
* `yyy`
* `yyyy`
* `M` "Did you mean `mm` (minutes)"
* `MM` "Did you mean `mm` (minutes)"
* `MMM`
* `MMMM`

`TimeSpan` doesn't operator with 12 vs 24h clock, so this is invalid:
* `HH` "Did you mean `hh` (hours)"


* `D` "Did you mean `dd` (days)"
* `DD` "Did you mean `dd` (days)"

Special cases:
* `d` alone doesn't work, use `%d` or in a pattern `@"d\:h"`
* `h` alone doesn't work, use `%h` or in a pattern `@"h\:m"`
* `m` alone doesn't work, use `%d` or in a pattern `@"m\:s"`
* `s` alone doesn't work, use `%s` or in a pattern `@"s\:f"`
* `f` alone doesn't work, use `%f` or in a pattern `@"f\:ff"`
* `F` alone doesn't work, use `%F` or in a pattern `@"F\:ff"`

## Example

### Code with Diagnostic

```csharp
var time = new TimeSpan(0, 10, 5).ToString(@"M", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); // AN0009 - Month not valid in TimeSpan formatting. Did you mean 'm' (minutes)?
```

### Code with Fix

```csharp
var time = new TimeSpan(0, 10, 5).ToString(@"m", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
```
